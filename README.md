## vim-antescofo

Syntax highlighting for [antescofo](http://support.ircam.fr/docs/Antescofo/manuals/) .asco and .asco.txt files

### install

Install with [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

`git clone https://github.com/MikeSperone/vim-antescofo.git ~/.vim/bundle/vim-antescofo`


This is my first vim syntax highlighting file, and I am very new to antescofo.  I will be updating this as I learn more about both, but I would love suggestions on how to make the highlighting more clear.
